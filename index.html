  <h1>main instruments</h1>
  <h2>guitar</h2>
  <p>British voiced amps are always a good start. Marshall, orange, Laney, hovercraft, although a lot of sludge bands used crates and Randall solid state amps, and I believe crowbar uses 5150's. There's really no rules to guitars, although the
    traditional way to go is a Gibson, I've seen people use telecasters no problem. Most doom bands use either fuzz or overdrive or a combination, high gain distortion pedals aren't really used that often because people would usually rather get that
    tube amp distortion. If you started your rig off with an orange, an sg/lp tuned down, and a super overdrive and/or a big muff you'd have a decent starting point for what you're looking for.</p>
  <h2>drum</h2>
  <p>Most of the real good sounding gear is either going to be impossible to find or super expensive but their are some good budget choices too. I highly suggest checking out a peavey Windsor if your on a budget. Super cheap and has a great stoner
    sound out of the box but can sound even better with some easy mods. I play through a sovtek MIG 100h and an emperor cab but the other dude I jam with has a Windsor thru a Marshall 1960 and it sounds great too.</p>
  <h2>bass</h2>
  <p>A lot of Kyuss/Qotsa sounds can be had running any sort of muff variant and using the neck pickup of a humbucker guitar. They also happened to use a lot of old Ampeg bass amps, though I know Josh uses a whole range of amps now. Down tuning is
    pretty important, and as far as effects fuzz and OD are the biggest ones, though I find an EQ pedal pushing all the frequencies to the max can also sound pretty awesome.</p>
